## ðŸš§ _UNDER DEVELOPMENT_ ðŸš§

**Only use debrix in it's current state to experiment. Most features are not implemented or tested yet and will break.** Debrix is far from being complete and is under active development. Don't post the library in a forum or similar, I don't want the project to have much attention yet. Ideas and questions are very welcome under the [discussions](https://github.com/debrixjs/debrix/discussions) on github.

## Installation

SemVer allows breaking changes in any release! Make sure to --save-exact to avoid breakning your application.

```
npm install --save-exact rollup-plugin-debrix
```
