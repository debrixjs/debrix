## ðŸš§ _UNDER DEVELOPMENT_ ðŸš§

**Only use debrix in it's current state to experiment. Most features are not implemented or tested yet and will break.** Debrix is far from being complete and is under active development. Don't post the library in a forum or similar, I don't want the project to have much attention yet. Ideas and questions are very welcome under the [discussions](https://github.com/debrixjs/debrix/discussions) on github.

## Contributing Notice

Code contributing is currently not possible due to the ongoing drastic changes. However, ideas and questions are much appriciated in [discussions](https://github.com/debrixjs/debrix/discussions). All planned features and found issues are documented as [issues](https://github.com/debrixjs/debrix/issues).
