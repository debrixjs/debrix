Debrix is a MVVM library for building web user interfaces. Components are truly declarative and nativly reactive with a model. Debrix components are compiled into lightweight runtime code. Debrix progressivly re-renders parts of the DOM to stay in sync with the model without any processing (e.g. virtual dom). Components are explicit and simple to write, document, maintain and read.

## ðŸš§ _UNDER DEVELOPMENT_ ðŸš§

https://playground.debrix.dev/

Debrix is far from being complete. The library is under active development. Most features are not implemented or tested yet and **will** break. Only use debrix is it's current state to experiment. Don't post the library in a forum or similar, I don't want the project to have much attention yet. Ideas and questions are very welcome under the [discussions](https://github.com/debrixjs/debrix/discussions). See the [contributing notice](#contributing-notice).
